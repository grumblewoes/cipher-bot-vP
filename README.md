# cipher-bot-vP
Rune Transcription

A discord bot that helps translate/transcribe between latin characters and Younger Futhark unicode characters. This is now deprecated with Discord's new guild update, also since I don't use Heroku for hosting anymore.

cipher.js - Presents the Unicode characters and their latin name equivalents for command purposes.

help.js - The help command that displays the list of possible commands to users.

transcribe.js - Using the desired latin character, will display information about the runic equivalent.

translate.js - Using the desired runic name, will display information about possible latin character equivalents (since a rune sometimes has multiple latin equivalents).

write.js - Using rune names separated by spaces, a user can write a message and receives the text in Unicode characters as output.
